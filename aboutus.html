      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Our engineers</i></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">A group of young engineers brainstormed what solutions could be created for a problem. The issue was, what problem could THEY, solve? The world is so big, and the scale of the issues to solutions is enormous.. just the thought made us tired. And that was it! By creating a code and real-time detection system, we could catch drivers' drowsiness and send them alerts to help prevent a crash. Through months of code, troubleshooting, and trials, we've created a hopefully revolutionary product to bring you a better road.</p>
